                 The LPU Harmonic Chorale – the official singing ambassadors of LPU Cavite, is a group with one thing in common: the love for music. Not only do they share their talents on numerous occasions inside the school, but they also participate in competitions and performances outside the university. This group sings not only with their gifted voices, but also with their passionate hearts. Founded in 2008, this group has been continuously growing as a family bonded by music.
